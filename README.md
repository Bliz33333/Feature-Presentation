# Feature-Presentation
The objective of this part of the research was to research the features and basics of C++ to learn what basic tools it has that Java does not. This was done throughout the process of learning basic C++: as I went through the C++ beginner guides I noted down everything that seemed not present in Java. Then I used researched more about each tool and how they are used. Lastly I made a program that showed these features off and a video describing it.
